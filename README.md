# WeatherApp

The Weather app provides a weather forecast for the next three days based on the user's zip code. 

#### Project Rationale

This project explores implementing security in a C# application and demonstrates secure coding practices.

#### How to Use

This app runs on Windows and allows you to check the weather for the next 3 days.

Thank you for downloading the app.

**How to install Windows:** Run WeatherApp_1.0.0.1_x64.msix
If you need to trust the certificate then run WeatherApp_1.0.0.1_x64.cer and add it to your "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" store.

**How to install Android:** Run the APK
You may need to select "more details" and click "install anyway" as the app is not from an app store.

**How to use the app:** Enter your zip code and press the button. There are a limited number of weather requests you can make before you need to wait until it resets.

#### Static Analysis Security TestingÂ (SAST)

I used Microsoft Code Analysis tools in Visual Studio to ensure my code met quality and security standards.

When running the SAST I found I had to fix several variables that could be null as well as remove a using statement and optimize some code.

#### Secrets

If you download and want to run the project in your visual studio, you will need to create and fill out a secrets class.

```C#
   static class Secrets
    {

        private static string OpenAIKey = "Your Key";
        private static string WeatherApiKey = "Your Key";
        private static string LogFileDebugPath = "Path you want to store log file";

        public static void InitializeKeys()
        {
            SecureStorage.SetAsync("OpenAIApiKey", OpenAIKey);
            SecureStorage.SetAsync("WeatherApiKey", WeatherApiKey);
            SecureStorage.SetAsync("LogFileDebugPath", LogFileDebugPath);

            Logger.Log("Keys Initialized");
        }


    }
```

Thank you for using my weather app!
